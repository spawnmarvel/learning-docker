# Docker compose reference

The Compose file is a YAML file defining services, networks and volumes. The default path for a Compose file is ./docker-compose.yml.

A service definition contains configuration that is applied to each container started for that service, much like passing command-line parameters to docker run. Likewise, network and volume definitions are analogous to docker network create and docker volume create.

As with docker run, options specified in the Dockerfile, such as CMD, EXPOSE, VOLUME, ENV, are respected by default - you don't need to specify them again in docker-compose.yml.
