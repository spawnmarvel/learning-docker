# Prometheus

* Prometheus collects and stores its metrics as time series data, i.e. metrics information is stored with the timestamp at which it was recorded, alongside optional key-value pairs called labels.
* It is now a standalone open source project and maintained independently of any company. 


## Features

* a multi-dimensional data model with time series data identified by metric name and key/value pairs
* PromQL, a flexible query language to leverage this dimensionality
* no reliance on distributed storage; single server nodes are autonomous
* time series collection happens via a pull model over HTTP
* pushing time series is supported via an intermediary gateway
* targets are discovered via service discovery or static configuration
* multiple modes of graphing and dashboarding support
