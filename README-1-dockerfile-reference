# Dockerfile reference

Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile. 

A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. 

This page describes the commands you can use in a Dockerfile.

https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/


When you run a build, the builder attempts to reuse layers from earlier builds. 

If a layer of an image is unchanged, then the builder picks it up from the build cache. 

If a layer has changed since the last build, that layer, and all layers that follow, must be rebuilt.

```bash

FROM
WORKDIR
COPY
RUN download
COPY . .
RUN use the download
RUN
ENTRYPOINT ["PATH OR FILE", ARGS]
```
