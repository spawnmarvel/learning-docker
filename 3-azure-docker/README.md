# Introduction to Docker containers

## Introduction

* you don't have to configure hardware and spend time installing operating systems and software to host a deployment.
* isolated from each other, and multiple containers can run on the same hardware.
* maximum compatibility in each environment with little or no configuration changes.

## What is Docker

* Docker Engine
* The Docker client
* The Docker server

The Docker server is a daemon named dockerd. The dockerd daemon responds to requests from the client via the Docker REST API and can interact with other daemons. The Docker server is also responsible for tracking the lifecycle of our containers.

* Docker objects

These include networks, storage volumes, plugins, and other service objects. 

* Docker Hub

Docker Hub is a Software as a Service (SaaS) Docker container registry.
